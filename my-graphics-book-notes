BOOKMARK: Finished reading "Perspective Projection", haven't coded it yet.

To push to github (after commit):
git push github master

If you don't want to redraw all the points each time, use canvas.
See wiki page, love.graphics, Types, Canvas.

If you want to try this with SFML, I think you could try using VertexArray.

SFML is written in and geared toward C++
whereas
SDL is written in and geared toward C

So maybe better to either use C++ for this, or learn sdl and use C.
Of course, both languages are fully supported in both libraries.
